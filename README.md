This program is a program to run a machine learning model that uses the Random Forest (RF) algorithm provided by Scikit-learn. The following is an explanation of the program.

1. Preprocessing
   a. The required modules are imported
   b. Datasets are imported and analyzed
   
2. Building the model
   a. The algorithm used is Random forest
   Model performance is improved through Grid Seach method
   
4. Evaluation
   Model performance is evaluated through the coefficient of determination (R2), mean squared error, and mean absolute error.
